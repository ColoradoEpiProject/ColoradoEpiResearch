# Directory Contents

This project contains the following subdirectories: 

- `data_clean`: Includes datasets that are ready for statistical analysis
and visualization.
- `data_raw`: If included, has data prior to preprocessing. Scripts in the 
"R" folder or the "reports_script" folder will provide the code for preprocessing
this data and saving output in the `data_clean` folder.
- `R`: Code for functions and / or scripts used in cleaning or analyzing the 
data. These may be called or otherwise used in conjunction with code in the 
`reports_script` folder.
- `reports_script`: Rmarkdown files that incorporate code to conduct analyses
and create visualizations of the data for the project. The resulting 
rendered documents should be output to the `reports_rendered` folder. 
- `reports_rendered`: This folder contains the rendered output files from the
Rmds in `reports_script`. The files in this folder should be considered
"read-only"---don't edit them directory, instead edit the associated Rmd in
`reports_script` and re-render it.
- `z_old`: A spot for you to chuck old, outdated files. Ideally, you would 
track with git and just delete old files as you supersede them with new versions, 
but in case you feel like you really need to hold on to some, this is where to 
put them. The "z" at the front of the directory name is to make sure this 
directory is one of the last to show up (alphabetically) in your file finder.
- `z_other`: A spot for you to save any file that doesn't fit into the other
categories. Examples include codebooks for datasets, IRB protocol documents, 
etc.
